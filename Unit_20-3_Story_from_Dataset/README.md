# Poisonous and Edible Mushroom Classification

## Notes to Improve on

Modeling and visualization:
 - Recall would be preferred over accuracy. Minimize false negatives, given poisonous is true: tp/(tp+fn).
 - A good visualization to include is ROC curve.

Presentation and storytelling:
 - Establish the problem or a problem's background more. Make a stronger case for "why" or a call to action.
 - Add future steps or future work in the conclusion.
